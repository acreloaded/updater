# ACR-Launcher

A auto updater/launcher for ACR. :)
Currently only supports windows. 

Working on other OS support. 

To use the ACR Launcher, place the ACR Launcher.exe in any folder of your choice. Then run ACR Launcher.exe, Once the launcher has shown click 'Install ACR' and it will download the latest AssaultCube Reloaded for you. Once download complete you will have the option to Start Client or Start Server. Easy as 1 2 3! Enjoy!!
